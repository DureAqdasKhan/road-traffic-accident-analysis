# Road Traffic Accident Analysis

This project explores UK road traffic accident data (2020) using advanced data mining and statistical techniques to uncover accident patterns, identify high-risk areas, and provide actionable insights for improving road safety.

ðŸ“„ Includes: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Clustering, Association Rule Mining (Apriori), Time Series Forecasting (SARIMA), and Social Network Analysis.

Research Objectives

1. To identify temporal patterns of road accidents by analyzing daily and hourly trends across the UK.

2. To determine environmental and traffic conditions influencing accident severity using the Apriori algorithm.

3. To cluster regional accident hotspots (Hull, North Lincolnshire, etc.) and interpret their spatial characteristics.

4. To forecast future accident occurrences using SARIMA and ARIMA models for key policing regions.

5. To evaluate social network structures (Facebook dataset) through community detection and centrality analysis.
